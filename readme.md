## **📖 Usage Instructions**  
1. **Set Up the Hardware:**  
   - Connect ESP32 to LED lights and DC motors.  
   - Ensure all connections are secure and powered correctly.  

2. **Prepare the Software:**  
   - Install Thhony IDE and ESP32 board support.  
   - Clone the [project repository](#).  
   - Wi-Fi credentials in the code (`SSID` and `Password`). <br> `# Make sure it is in 2.5 ghz`
   - Upload the code to ESP32.  

3. **Access the Interface:**  
   - Note the IP address displayed in shell.  
   - Start the webpage by <br> `Open CMD in Webpage folder`<br> `Type **index.html** an d Open the IP Link Shown` <br> `Enter the IP address shown in shell`<br>`Start the Use of IOT`
